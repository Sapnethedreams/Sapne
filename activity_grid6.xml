So we indulge the children in various kinds of activities of their own interest and also in other activities which can benefit them in future. We dance together , we sing together , we play together , we study together , we giggle together , we gossip together , we share our memories , our experiences in those two hours of regular camps organized by Sapne For us , every sapna , every dream is important and hence we try our best to accomplish that , if not accomplish , we try our best to give that dream , a direction. For this , we provide teachers , who are skilled in their field of work and accordingly they teach , they train the students . In this way teachers get the platform to teach and express or share their knowledge , moreover , increase their knowledge , and students get quality education"/>
